# Kieran Howard MSc UMI Analysis Scripts

This repository contains several subfolders which are used to analyse UMI data from the respective companies. Before starting, first install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) (tested with conda v4.10.3 and python 3.8.8) and create an environment using the included UMI_env.yml file:
`conda env create --file UMI_env.yml`

Each folder also contains a yml configuration file with various parameters that can be altered to change the analyse parameters. Each script can be invoked individually (e.g. `python align_reads.py`) or the included shell script (`run_all.sh`) can be used to run all scripts, in order, to perform the full analysis. The run_all.sh script all has a parameter at the top to specify the amount of memory to allocate to the JVM for Java programs, such as BWA and Picard.  Each script will only perform its steps if the output files do not already exist (to save unnecessary re-processing of data), so if a step needs to be repeated with different parameters the original output files must first be remove/renamed to enable to reanalysis to take place.
